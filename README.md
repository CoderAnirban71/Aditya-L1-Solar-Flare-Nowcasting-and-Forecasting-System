## What This Does

Solar flares are sudden bursts of radiation that disrupt satellite communications, GPS, and power grids. This system:

- **Nowcasts** flares in real-time using SoLEXS (soft X-ray) and HEL1OS (hard X-ray) data from Aditya-L1
- **Forecasts** flares 5–15 minutes before they peak using an LSTM + Attention neural network
- **Visualizes** everything on a live dashboard with alerts, probability gauges, and scrolling event logs

## Physics Behind the Detection

**Statistical Triggering (Poisson Significance)**

X-ray photon detection is a counting process — discrete events that follow Poisson rather than Gaussian statistics.

```
Significance = (O - B) / √B

O = observed counts, B = 5-min rolling background
Threshold = 5σ  →  99.9% noise rejection
```

**Morphological Filtering (FRED Profile)**

Real solar flares follow a Fast Rise Exponential Decay shape caused by magnetic reconnection (fast rise: 1–5 min) followed by plasma cooling (slow decay: 10–30 min). Cosmic ray hits and instrument glitches produce instantaneous spikes and are rejected.

**Hardness Ratio**

```
Hardness Ratio = HEL1OS counts / SoLEXS counts

Normal sun  →  ratio ~0.2 (thermal emission)
Solar flare →  ratio >2.0  (non-thermal electrons)
```

The ratio separates thermal emission (always present from the quiet Sun) from non-thermal electron acceleration (only during flares) — a rising hardness ratio is a key precursor signature.

## ML Model

| Property | Value |
|---|---|
| Architecture | LSTM + Attention |
| Input features | 26 (raw flux + Poisson significance + hardness ratio + rate-of-change) |
| Hidden size | 256 |
| Layers | 3 |
| Window | 300 rows (~5 min history) |
| Lead time | 5–15 min (dynamic, based on probability) |
| Training data | July 2024 Aditya-L1 data (~88K samples) |
| Training device | NVIDIA RTX 4060 (CUDA 12.1) |

**Metrics on test set (July 25–31, 2024):**

| Metric | Value |
|---|---|
| HSS (Heidke Skill Score) | 0.317 |
| TPR (True Positive Rate) | 23.9% |
| FAR (False Alarm Rate) | 49.4% |
| Flares caught | 88 / 368 |
| Best threshold | 0.75 |

> HSS > 0 means the model performs meaningfully better than random guessing. TPR is expected to improve with more training data (currently 1 month; larger dataset retraining in progress).

## Data Source

Download Level-1 data from the **ISRO ISSDC PRADAN portal**:
`https://pradan1.issdc.gov.in`

**Required instruments:**
- `HEL1OS` → Hard X-ray (10–150 keV) — folder: `data/HEL1OS_satalite_data/2024/07/`
- `SoLEXS` → Soft X-ray (1–30 keV) — folder: `data/SOLEXS_satalite_data/`

Supplementary: NASA DONKI API (auto-downloaded by `benchmarking.py`)

## Setup

### Requirements

- Python 3.14 (main environment)
- Python 3.11 (GPU training environment — `gpu_env`)
- NVIDIA GPU with CUDA (for training; CPU works for inference)

### Install

```bash
# Main environment
pip install fastapi uvicorn pandas numpy astropy scikit-learn plotly streamlit

# GPU training environment (Python 3.11)
py -3.11 -m venv gpu_env
gpu_env\Scripts\activate
pip install torch torchvision torchaudio --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu121
pip install pandas numpy astropy scikit-learn matplotlib jupyter ipykernel
python -m ipykernel install --user --name gpu_env --display-name "Python 3.11 GPU"
```

---

## Running the Pipeline

### Step 1 — Process satellite data

```bash
python src/pipeline.py
```

Runs all 4 steps and generates:
- `outputs/master_data.csv`
- `outputs/triggered_data.csv`
- `outputs/flare_catalog.csv`
- `outputs/flare_catalog_labeled.csv`

To reprocess everything from scratch:
```bash
python src/pipeline.py --force
```

### Step 2 — Train the model (optional — pretrained weights not included)

Open `src/forecast.ipynb` in VS Code with the `Python 3.11 GPU` kernel and run all cells.

Outputs:
- `outputs/solar_flare_model.pth`
- `outputs/scaler.pkl`
- `outputs/model_meta.json`

### Step 3 — Launch the dashboard

```bash
# Activate GPU environment (needed for LSTM inference)
gpu_env\Scripts\activate

# Start FastAPI server
python src/server.py
```

Open browser: `http://localhost:8000`

## Dashboard Features

- **Live graphs** — SoLEXS and HEL1OS X-ray flux with logarithmic Y-axis and scrolling time window
- **Now line** — white vertical line showing current replay position
- **Nowcast panel** — real-time flare detection with glowing alert on detection
- **Forecast panel** — ML probability gauge (0–100%), dynamic lead time sentence (e.g. "In ~5-15 min — around 13:23:00 UTC")
- **Rolling detection cards** — upcoming flares with intensity-based red coloring
- **Live detected flares** — running log of nowcasted events
- **Event database** — full flare catalog sorted by significance

> Dashboard runs in replay mode using July 2024 Aditya-L1 data. Use the timeline slider to jump to any point. July 16, 2024 (~idx 1,975,000) has the strongest detected flare (4025σ).

## Known Limitations

- GOES calibration not available for SoLEXS counts — physics-based classification used instead
- Replay mode only — real-time PRADAN live feed not publicly available
